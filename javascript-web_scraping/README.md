## fs module

The fs module contains methods to interact with the file system. 
It contains methods to read, write, and delete files.

## require
The require function is used to import modules in node.js. when you call require,
it loads the given module and returns an object that contains
all the methods and properties. 

For example:

> `const fs = require('fs');`
>
> This line of codes defines a variable `fs`, then uses `require` to load
> the fs module, and stores it as an object in the `fs` module. It can then
> be used to call functions like `fs.readFile` or `fs.writeFile`.
